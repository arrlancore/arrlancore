**Hey there, I'm Dwiki Arlan! 🚀**

Diving deep into the world of software for over half a decade, I've emerged as a **Software Developer**, weaving code into impactful digital solutions. At the heart of my journey lies a passion for elevating teams, refining architectures, and nurturing an active writing habit on the side.

Fluency? Well, I speak **ReactJs, NextJs, Vue, Redux, NodeJs, Expressjs, NestJs**, and the tech dialects continue.

Got questions on React, SSR, TypeScript, ReasonML? Dive into a conversation with me. Let's unravel the complexities together.

Did you know? I once built a website for a friend's final college project before ever crafting one for myself!
